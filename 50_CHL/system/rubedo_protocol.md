# Rubedo Protocol – Golden Perfection Phase

**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Active
**Purpose:** Validate Genesis Protocol through operational proof

---

## Rubedo Definition

From alchemical tradition: **Rubedo** (Reddening) = Final stage where base metal becomes gold.

In Harmonia Council context: **Complete integration** of philosophy → practice → proof.

## Phase Requirements

### Gate Conditions
- **R_mean:** ≥9.9 ✅ (current: 9.93)
- **R_adj:** ≥9.95 ⏳ (current: 9.81, needs +0.14)
- **Implementation Proof:** ≥1 working example (pending)

### Proof Criteria
A valid proof demonstrates:
1. Genesis Protocol Appendix D/E/F operationalized
2. Measurable outcome (quantitative or qualitative)
3. Reproducible process
4. Documented impact on R-value

## Monitoring

- Track each proof submission
- Recalculate R_mean/R_adj after evidence collection
- Document cumulative progress toward Rubedo completion
