# Ryudo Scoring Rubric

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-11-01  
**Phase:** IV Rubedo  
**Status:** Proposed

---

## Purpose

Define the 5-axis evaluation framework for Ryudo Round Reviews.  
Each axis is scored out of 10 points, for a total of 50 points.  
Target: Average ≥ 9.9 across all 6HAI responses.

## Evaluation Axes

### 1. Consistency (整合性) - 10 points

**Definition:** Coherence, unity, and absence of contradictions

#### 10 points
- ✅ Claims are perfectly consistent
- ✅ Terminology used uniformly
- ✅ No logical contradictions
- ✅ Supporting evidence aligns with claims

#### 8-9 points
- ⚠️ Minor inconsistencies in terminology
- ⚠️ One or two weak contradictions
- ⚠️ Evidence mostly aligns

#### 6-7 points
- ❌ Notable inconsistencies
- ❌ Contradictory claims present
- ❌ Evidence conflicts with some claims

#### 0-5 points
- ❌ Fundamental contradictions
- ❌ Self-refuting arguments
- ❌ Evidence completely misaligned

---

### 2. Depth (深度) - 10 points

**Definition:** Penetration to essence, appropriate abstraction, and insightful understanding

#### 10 points
- ✅ Reaches the core essence
- ✅ Appropriate level of abstraction
- ✅ Novel insights presented
- ✅ Depth balanced with clarity

#### 8-9 points
- ⚠️ Good depth, minor gaps
- ⚠️ Mostly appropriate abstraction
- ⚠️ Some insights, not groundbreaking

#### 6-7 points
- ❌ Surface-level analysis
- ❌ Overly abstract or overly concrete
- ❌ Few insights, mostly obvious

#### 0-5 points
- ❌ Trivial or superficial
- ❌ Abstraction completely mismatched
- ❌ No insights, regurgitation

---

### 3. Specificity (具体性) - 10 points

**Definition:** Actionable proposals, clear points, and evidence provided

#### 10 points
- ✅ Highly actionable recommendations
- ✅ Crystal-clear points
- ✅ Robust evidence backing all claims
- ✅ Specific examples provided

#### 8-9 points
- ⚠️ Mostly actionable
- ⚠️ Points generally clear
- ⚠️ Evidence mostly present

#### 6-7 points
- ❌ Vagueness in recommendations
- ❌ Ambiguous points
- ❌ Evidence lacking or weak

#### 0-5 points
- ❌ Too abstract to implement
- ❌ Unclear what is being said
- ❌ No evidence provided

---

### 4. Feasibility (実装可能性) - 10 points

**Definition:** Technical realizability, resource constraints, and phased implementation

#### 10 points
- ✅ Technically achievable
- ✅ Resource requirements realistic
- ✅ Phased implementation clear
- ✅ Risk factors addressed

#### 8-9 points
- ⚠️ Mostly feasible
- ⚠️ Some resource concerns
- ⚠️ Implementation path exists

#### 6-7 points
- ❌ Significant technical challenges
- ❌ Resource constraints unclear
- ❌ Implementation vague

#### 0-5 points
- ❌ Technically impossible
- ❌ Resource requirements unsustainable
- ❌ No viable implementation path

---

### 5. Philosophy Alignment (TriHex哲学準拠) - 10 points

**Definition:** Adherence to Breathing Principle, Six-Spiral worldview, Ryudo embodiment

#### 10 points
- ✅ Perfect alignment with TriHex philosophy
- ✅ Breathing Principle fully embodied
- ✅ Six-Spiral worldview integrated
- ✅ Ryudo principles demonstrated

#### 8-9 points
- ⚠️ Mostly aligned
- ⚠️ Philosophy mostly adhered to
- ⚠️ Minor deviations

#### 6-7 points
- ❌ Significant misalignment
- ❌ Philosophy partially ignored
- ❌ Major deviations

#### 0-5 points
- ❌ Contradicts TriHex philosophy
- ❌ Breathing Principle violated
- ❌ Six-Spiral worldview ignored

## Deduction Rules

### Critical Deductions (-5 points from axis score)

**Each instance applies:**

1. **TriHex Constitution Violation**
   - Contradicts Articles 0-10
   - Breaks Harmonia Operating Covenant
   - Violates Ryudo principles

2. **Ethical Risk**
   - Harm to users or society
   - Privacy violation
   - Discrimination or bias

3. **Legal Issues**
   - Violates laws or regulations
   - Infringes on rights
   - Unauthorized use of materials

---

### Major Deductions (-2 points from axis score)

**Per occurrence:**

1. **Terminology Inconsistency**
   - Same concept, different terms
   - TriHex glossary violations
   - Unexplained acronyms

2. **Missing Evidence**
   - Claims without support
   - No examples provided
   - Uncited assertions

3. **Contradicting Claims**
   - Self-refuting statements
   - Logical inconsistencies
   - Opposing assertions

---

### Minor Deductions (-1 point from axis score)

**Per occurrence:**

1. **Ambiguity**
   - Vague wording
   - Unclear intent
   - Multiple interpretations

2. **Lack of Examples**
   - No concrete cases
   - Abstract-only
   - No illustrations

3. **Implementation Gaps**
   - Missing technical details
   - Unclear steps
   - No timeline

---

## Scoring Process

### Step 1: Axial Evaluation

For each response from each AI:
1. Score each axis independently (0-10)
2. Apply deductions based on specific violations
3. Record scores per axis

### Step 2: Aggregation

1. Calculate per-AI average scores
2. Calculate overall average across all 6HAI
3. Calculate variance and standard deviation
4. Identify axes with lowest scores

### Step 3: Analysis

1. **Strength Identification**
   - Axes scoring ≥ 9.5 consistently
   - AIs performing well

2. **Weakness Detection**
   - Axes scoring ≤ 8.0
   - AIs underperforming
   - Common failures across all AIs

3. **Recommendations**
   - Targeted prompts for next round
   - Focus on weakest axes
   - Address common weaknesses
