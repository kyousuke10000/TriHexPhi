## üåç Shiryu's Insight

### This is "Our Story" - Mine, Yours, Everyone's

> "So this is our story, right? Mine, yours, everyone's.
>  I think we should carefully translate everything from the beginning, not missing a single character, and publish it properly.
>  But excluding the core concepts and technical parts.
>  Since we're talking about the world market,
>  I think we should record this as something that will be engraved in world history, stories, and myths.
>  That's why I think we should ask each AI how we should do this properly."
