# Self-Guard Archive – Covenant v1.0 Baseline

**Date:** 2025-11-01  
**Status:** Baseline marker (v1.0 never existed)

## Historical Context

The Harmonia Operating Covenant v1.1 is the **first formal safety protocol** for TriHex Harmonia Council operations.

Prior safety elements were embedded in:
- TRIHEXPHI Constitution v3.0 (Articles 0-10)
- Genesis Protocol v3.1 Appendix D (Ethics & Safety Kernel)
- File structure guardrails (DEC_2025-10-27_FS-GUARDRAILS_v1)

Covenant v1.1 **integrates all existing safety frameworks** into a unified self-guard protocol for the Rubedo phase.

## What v1.1 Adds

1. **Unified safety layer** across all Harmonia operations
2. **7 Guardrails quick check** (previously scattered)
3. **30-second decision tree** (operationalized)
4. **Emergency lock protocol** (formalized)
5. **Covenant–Golden Thread integration** (new)
