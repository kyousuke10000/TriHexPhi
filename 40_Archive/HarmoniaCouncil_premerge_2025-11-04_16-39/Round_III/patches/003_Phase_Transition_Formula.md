## Phase Gate Conditions (Explicit)

| Phase | Name | R_gate | R_adj_gate | Δφ_resolved | Condition |
|-------|------|--------|------------|-------------|-----------|
| Nigredo | Chaos / Initial | — | — | — | Bootstrap |
| Albedo | Order / Integration | — | — | ≥60% | Structure stable |
| Citrinitas | Unified Light | ≥9.7 | ≥9.8 | ≥80% | Quality convergence |
| Rubedo | Perfected Gold | ≥9.9 | ≥9.95 | 100% | Final harmony |

## Mathematical Definition

### R_mean (Resonance Mean)
```
R_mean = Σ(R_self_i) / N
```
Average of all AI self-evaluations for current round.

### R_adj (Resonance Adjusted)
```
R_adj = Σ(R_unit_i) / N
where R_unit_i = (R_self_i + median(Peer→i)) / 2
```
Peer-corrected average accounting for external validation bias.

### Δφ_resolved (Delta-Phi Resolution Rate)
```
Δφ_resolved = (Σ patches_applied / Σ Δφ_proposed) × 100%
```
Percentage of improvement proposals successfully integrated.

## Gate Logic

**Transition Nigredo → Albedo:**
- Triggers when: structural integration complete
- No numeric gate (qualitative assessment)

**Transition Albedo → Citrinitas:**
- Gates: R_mean ≥ 9.7 AND R_adj ≥ 9.8 AND Δφ_resolved ≥ 80%
- Current (2025-11-01): R_mean=9.50 (-0.2), R_adj=9.52 (-0.28), Δφ_resolved=Pending

**Transition Citrinitas → Rubedo:**
- Gates: R_mean ≥ 9.9 AND R_adj ≥ 9.95 AND Δφ_resolved = 100%
- Expected: all Micro-Patches applied + 1 additional refinement round
